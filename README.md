# Real-Time-Face-Eye-Detection-with-OpenCV-
A Python-based real-time face and eye detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers. This project captures live video from a webcam and detects human faces and eyes in each frame using pre-trained machine learning models.  ðŸ”§ Technologies Used Python 3  OpenCV (cv2)  Haar Cascade Classifiers
